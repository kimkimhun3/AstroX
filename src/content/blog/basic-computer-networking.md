# Basic Computer Networking

## Introduction

Computer networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources, exchange data, and communicate. Networks can range from simple setups, like home networks, to complex enterprise-level networks.

## Key Concepts

1. **Network Types**:
    - **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Covers a small geographic area, like a home or office.
    - **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Covers a large geographic area, often a country or continent.
    - **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: Spans a city or large campus.

2. **Network Topologies**:
    - **Bus Topology**: All devices share a single communication line.
    - **Star Topology**: All devices are connected to a central hub.
    - **Ring Topology**: Each device is connected to two other devices, forming a ring.
    - **Mesh Topology**: Devices are interconnected with many redundant connections.

3. **Network Devices**:
    - **Router**: Connects multiple networks and directs data between them.
    - **Switch**: Connects devices within a single network, directing data to its destination.
    - **Modem**: Converts digital data to analog signals and vice versa for transmission over phone lines.
    - **Access Point**: Allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network.

4. **Networking Protocols**:
    - **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)**: Fundamental protocol suite for most networks.
    - **HTTP/HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol/Secure)**: Protocols for web communication.
    - **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: Used for transferring files.
    - **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: Used for email transmission.

5. **IP Addressing**:
    - **IPv4**: 32-bit address format (e.g., 192.168.0.1).
    - **IPv6**: 128-bit address format, designed to replace IPv4 due to address exhaustion.

6. **Subnets**:
    - Division of a network into smaller, manageable sections.
    - Uses subnet masks to define network and host portions of an IP address.

## Explanation

### Network Types

- **LAN**: Typically used within a single building, such as an office or home. It provides high-speed connectivity within the limited area.
- **WAN**: Connects LANs that are geographically separated. The Internet is the largest WAN.
- **MAN**: Larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, used to connect multiple LANs within a city.

### Network Topologies

- **Bus Topology**: Easy to install and manage, but a failure in the main cable can bring down the entire network.
- **Star Topology**: More reliable since a failure in one cable doesn't affect the others, but if the central hub fails, the whole network goes down.
- **Ring Topology**: Data travels in one direction, reducing the chance of collisions, but a break in the ring can disable the network.
- **Mesh Topology**: Provides high redundancy and reliability, but is complex and expensive to implement.

### Network Devices

- **Router**: Essential for connecting different networks and managing traffic between them.
- **Switch**: Operates at the data link layer to forward data to the correct destination within the same network.
- **Modem**: Necessary for Internet connectivity over telephone lines.
- **Access Point**: Facilitates wireless connectivity, expanding the reach of a wired network.

### Networking Protocols

- **TCP/IP**: The foundational protocol suite for internet and network communication.
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Ensures the transfer of web pages and secure transactions on the web.
- **FTP**: Allows for the transfer of files between computers.
- **SMTP**: Used for sending emails from one server to another.

### IP Addressing and Subnets

- **IPv4**: Most common form of IP addressing, but limited by the number of unique addresses available.
- **IPv6**: Developed to address the limitations of IPv4, providing a vastly larger address space.
- **Subnets**: Allow for efficient IP address management and enhance network security by segmenting the network.
